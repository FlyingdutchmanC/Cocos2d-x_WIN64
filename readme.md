This is an updated Version of Cocos2d-x 3.17 for full Windows x86 and x64 support as well as linux.
The cmake files are updated and the libraries are compiled for x64 as well.
I have no rights on Cocos2d-x nor on the added libraries.
The rights belong to the developer of those software modules.
This project is just to inform how to enable x64 support to Cocos2d-x in cmake.
See: https://www.cocos.com/ and https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x
